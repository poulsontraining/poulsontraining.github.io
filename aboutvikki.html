											<p><br/>Hello! I am Vikki Poulson, a certified Personal Trainer focusing on the health, happiness and fitness of my clients. My studio is located on Imperial Way, Purley, I also offer home visits or training at outdoor spaces if you prefer. I cover the following areas; Sutton, Carshalton, Hackbridge, Wallington, Waddon, Purley and South Croydon.</p>
											<p>A bit about my fitness story... I grew up dancing and spent years learning all styles of dance, culminating in competing in Ballroom and Latin dance across the UK for the University of Southampton whilst completing my degree. I then headed to London, as many do, and spent five years working in central London.</p>
											<p>It was during this time that I stopped dancing and turned to many other types of exercise in order to stay fit around my office job. I started running in the parks, exercising to workout videos and yoga tutorials in my lounge. Performing HIIT workouts in my garden and going on bike rides round the outskirts of London with my friends.</p>
											<p>After five years I decided to have a break from London and headed off to travel around Asia and Europe with my husband. It was during this year that I started to realise how big a role exercise had played throughout my life in keeping my stress levels down and energy up when work and life had felt like it was getting on top of me.</p>
										</div>
										
									</div>
									
									<p>I decided it was time to educate myself on a broader range of exercises and the relationship they have with our bodies and to help others see the benefits all types of activities can have on our day to day lives.</p>
									<p>On my return to the UK I retrained to become a Level 2 Fitness Instructor and Level 3 Personal Trainer and joined a large health and fitness club to gain as much experience as I could teaching group fitness classes, group PT and 1 to 1 PT.</p>
									<p>I now work with clients in the studio and at their homes with the aim of providing people with the knowledge, motivation and understanding of how best exercise can transform all aspects of their lives.</p>

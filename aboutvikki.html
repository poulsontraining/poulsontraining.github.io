											<p>Me in a nutshell...</p>
											<ul>
											<li>I love being outdoors be that walking, hiking, kayaking or swimming</li>
											<li>I have two young children I hope to share this passion with. You will regularly find us in the New Forest or heading to the beach</li>
											<li>I’m a big fan of all animals, although I currently don’t have a pet of my own I will happily steal a cuddle from yours!</li>
											<li>I like spending time with family and friends eating, playing games and watching movies</li>
											<li>My most annoying habits are always singing the wrong words to songs with confidence and always falling asleep by 10pm even on special occasions (one day I’ll make it to midnight on new years eve!)</li>
											<li>I’m passionate about supporting people suffering from pain or injury but motivated to safely get their health and fitness back on track</li>

									<p>The long story...</p>
									<p>I love working with people who have enjoyed exercising throughout their life, be that hiking, playing tennis or dancing, but now realise their body needs special attention to overcome the niggles in their knees, arthritis in their hands or stiff shoulders in order for them to keep up their fitness.</p>
									<p>I help educate them on how resistance training, balance and co-ordination work and aerobic exercise can help them safely return to the activities they once loved and enjoy moving their bodies again. </p>
									<p>Since qualifying as a personal trainer I have continued my education completing the following qualifications:</p>

												<p>My fitness journey...</p>
												<p>Growing up I kept fit by enjoying all types of dance, cycling with my family at the weekends and learning water sports in the summers on our holidays in Dorset.</p>
												<p>I took my dancing to the next level whilst completing a Maths degree at Southampton University and competed nationally in Ballroom and Latin. During this time I enjoyed going to Zumba and step classes at the University sports centre and cycling to my lectures.</p>
												<p>After Uni my husband and I moved to central London and I got a job as a trainee accountant. I spent the next few years travelling round the country to client sites and living out of hotel rooms. It was during this time that I started doing body weight workouts in my hotel room to keep fit whilst not having access to equipment and limited room.</p>
												<p>After a few years of the 9-5 slog we decided to quit our jobs, leave London and travel for a year. During this awesome adventure we hiked, swam, cycled and kayaked around India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Europe. We converted a van into a campervan and I took a set of dumbbells, a skipping rope and a yoga mat.</p>
												
											</div>
	
									</div>
									
									<p>I loved the challenge of creating new and interesting workouts with the kit I had as well as using the landscape of where we were staying. It was during this time that I realised how essential exercise and keeping fit was to my health and happiness. I had a few injuries and niggles from dancing in 3 inch heels for 10 years and I wanted to learn more about how exercise could improve my quality of life.</p>
									<p>On our return to the UK I qualified as a Level 2 Gym Instructor and Level 3 Personal Trainer. I started work at a large gym and started working regularly with weights. Over the coming years I gradually specialised in working with individuals who are living with injuries or pain but keen to get fitter, more mobile and increase their energy levels.</p>
									<p>I now enjoy training people from my studio where you can enjoy working out in private.</p>

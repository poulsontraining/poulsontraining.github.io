											<p></br>What is Personal Training with Vikki?</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Understanding and developing your specific health and fitness goals</li>
												<li>Assessing your current fitness and injuries and how best to rehabilitate your body</li>
												<li>Creating a personalised long term sustainable plan to achieve your goals and get back to working with your body rather than against it</li>
												<li>Learning movements and exercises that are tailored to you and your body’s needs and that you enjoy </li>
												<li>Progressing movements over time to build strength, balance, co-ordination, flexibility, aerobic fitness and body awareness</li>
												<li>Having fun and building mental and physical strength </li>
												<li>Building a relationship with each other in a safe environment</li>
												<li>Being supported through your journey to regular exercise, and movement being a pain free part of your everyday life</li>
											</ul>
											
											<p></br>Who is Personal Training with Vikki for?</p>
						
											<ul>
												<li>An individual looking for personalised 1-1 professional support in getting their health and fitness back on track </li>
												<li>Someone who feels their body can’t perform the way it used to due to injury, pain or wear and tear and wants a bespoke programme to fit their needs</li>
												<li>Individuals who may not have any experience in the gym or using gym equipment, that want to be educated on safe exercises to suit their body</li>
												<li>Those looking to be inspired to work hard on their health and fitness journey without being shouted at or made to feel silly</li>
											
											</ul>
											
											<p></br>What happens when I sign up?</p>

											<ul>
												<li>On signing up for Personal Training with Vikki we will have a consultation where we get to know each other, your exercise history, any injuries or conditions and what your goals are</li>
												<li>I will then tailor a programme for your specific needs which we will use together in our sessions </li>
												<li>This programme will be constantly monitored and progressed depending on your bodies needs and what you are enjoying</li>
												<li>Goals are then reassessed and programmes updated to ensure we are constantly moving in the right direction</li>
											
												
											</ul>
		
											<p></br>What is your commitment?</p>

											<ul>
												<li>To understand there are no quick fixes. Improving your health and fitness takes time, commitment and consistency</li>
												<li>To be as honest as possible - communication is key for us to understand what does and doesn’t work for your body and to learn how you enjoy moving it</li>
												<li>To train a minimum of twice a week with me, you’ll hear me say it many times, consistency is key and the quicker you can build a routine the faster you’ll see results</li>
												
											</ul>
											
											<p></br>What is Vikki's commitment?</p>

											<ul>
												<li>To listen to your personal requirements and programme exercises accordingly – no burpees or one armed handstands</li>
												<li>To inspire you to exercise regularly and enjoy sessions </li>
												<li>To educate you on the best exercises for your body – ultimately I want you to feel confident enough to know what works and what doesn’t work for your body</li>
												<li>To rehabilitate injuries and niggles to make movement feel as comfortable as possible – bending down to pick up grandchildren and lifting the shopping out the car shouldn’t require a second thought</li>

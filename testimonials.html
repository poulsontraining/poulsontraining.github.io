										<h1>Testimonials</h1>
									</header>
										
										<h3>Tracy, 55</h3>
											<blockquote>My husband gave me three months notice to get ski fit, I am 55 and needed help! Vikki designed me a fantastic programme, based on three sessions a week for 12 weeks, she tailored the session to my ability and gradually increased my fitness in preparation for my holiday. Each session worked on different areas and she made it really fun (never thought I'd say that about gym training). I am now hooked and have told my husband I need a personal trainer all year round if he expects me to ski in my fifties! Thank you Vikki, I am really looking forward to my next ski holiday.</blockquote>
										<h3>Sam, 27</h3>
											<blockquote>I have a nerve related medical condition in my elbow that means it is painful to lift weights with my elbow bent past 90 degrees. I had pretty much given up any hope of working out at the gym (any excuse eh) until I met Vikki. She wrote an entire training plan for me, modifying traditional exercises and adding in new ones to avoid any strain on my elbow. She is great at thinking outside the box and is continually giving me new things to try. Can't thank her enough.</blockquote>
										<h3>Judy, 60</h3>
											<blockquote>I have just done my first ever circuits class with Vikki - and it was great! I was very anxious because I was about 30 years older than most of the other women there...and considerably larger. I needn't have worried. Vikki is so enthusiastic, caring and encouraging. She spent time with everyone and didn't just concentrate on the most athletic. She adjusted some of the circuits where my knees were'nt up to what the others were doing. So I could still get a good workout and felt I had achieved something. It's made me realise it's not what type of exercise I do that makes me come back to a class again but the personality of the trainer.
											</blockquote>
										<h3>Alex, 29</h3>
											<blockquote>After struggling to motivate myself to exercise as frequently as I wanted I asked Vikki for some help. Through a varied programme she taught me that exercise can be so much more than just running on a treadmill or performing the same exercises every week, tailoring my workouts to the aspects of exercise I find most enjoyable. Not only do I find my time in the gym more fulfilling but I am enjoying my new found ability to beat my mates up the hill when we go for a cycle at the weekend.</blockquote>

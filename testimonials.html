										<h1>Testimonials</h1>
									</header>
										
										<h3>Linda, 65</h3>
											<blockquote>I was nervous about training in a gym but knew that I had to regain the strength and fitness I had lost after breaking my leg or lose it forever. A trial session with Vikki gave me the confidence to sign up to a four week programme and now I’m hooked! What I appreciate is her ability to tailor a programme to my specific needs and to challenge me to push myself harder while encouraging every small achievement. When I was away for a couple of months over the summer, she very kindly put together a fitness programme that I could follow without going to the gym. I’m training now for a 100 kilometre walk but more importantly working out with Vikki is helping me to make improving and maintaining my fitness a key element of my lifestyle in retirement. It’s actually quite fun too!</blockquote>
										<h3>Marion, 75</h3>
											<blockquote>I’m a writer, busy and active, and before I retired I had a full time job, children, then grandchildren, so where do you fit in the time to exercise? Now my body tells me - I definitely had the balance wrong!  I have a lot of arthritis and sciatica from a couple of slipped discs. Things I used to be able to do easily are now painful, so of course I avoid doing them - and then my muscles weaken, and complain even more if I do try to use them. Vikki is helping me to work around all that, and to gradually get these weak muscles working better. I’ve been going to a pilates class for a few years and found it very helpful, but my particular body-issues kept getting in the way. Vikki's one-to-one guidance makes a fantastic difference. I like how systematic she is - the programme she has designed for me is clearly thought out, working towards each goal in simple stages. She’s encouraging but realistic. She explains what each exercise contributes so I understand why I'm doing it. It’s always at a level where I can feel competent and yet challenged, and she adapts the exercises constantly in response to how she sees them working for me.  I can’t change what’s happening to my joints but getting the muscles more active helps take the strain off them. I’ve known this for years, but having Vikki’s focused guidance has motivated me to practise in-between sessions, because I can already feel that it’s helping.</blockquote>
										<h3>Victoria, 54</h3>
											<blockquote>I’ve been training with Vikki for a relatively short period of time, three months, but can already see a huge difference.  Vikki tailors the programmes to her client, listens and adapts the exercises depending on the need and develops a new programme every four weeks.  I’ve had a shoulder injury for a couple of years and in the time I’ve been with Vikki she has improved my range of movement significantly, I am extremely happy. I’m impressed with her approach and professionalism and cannot recommend her highly enough.</blockquote>
										<h3>Nermin, 33</h3>
											<blockquote>Vikki is a superb trainer. She consistently checks in on how you're feeling and where you are with a workout, tailoring programmes and progression to your needs. She has been incredibly flexible during this year, working with clients to workout as per their Covid secure needs. Finally, I started working with Vikki because I wanted to learn how to use and incorporate weights into my workout. As a woman, that area of the gym has always been intimidating and Vikki really help demystify weight training and make it accessible. I had only planned on having  handful of sessions with her but a year later I am still working with her and I now love and look forward to working out - a testament to Vikki's skill, attitude, and professionalism as a PT!</blockquote>
										<h3>Emma, 29</h3>
											<blockquote>Vikki is such a great trainer! Since starting sessions with her I have been making steady progress towards my goals and I'm actually enjoying exercise for the first time in my life. I've recently had an injury and she's done a great job of adapting our sessions around it.</blockquote>
										<h3>Sam, 27</h3>
											<blockquote>I have a nerve related medical condition in my elbow that means it is painful to lift weights with my elbow bent past 90 degrees. I had pretty much given up any hope of working out at the gym (any excuse eh) until I met Vikki. She wrote an entire training plan for me, modifying traditional exercises and adding in new ones to avoid any strain on my elbow. She is great at thinking outside the box and is continually giving me new things to try. Can't thank her enough.</blockquote>
										<h3>Kristina, 48</h3>
											<blockquote>I really enjoyed working with Vikki. I had not trained for a number of years and was a bit nervous to get back into the routine. Vikki not only eased me in gently, she introduced me to new exercises that I found refreshing. My strength improved quickly and the early morning starts we’re becoming the new norm. She  also provided me with a comprehensive, easy to follow program that I could continue by myself - thanks for everything Vikki!!</blockquote>				
										<h3>Wendy and Steve, 54</h3>
											<blockquote>Myself and my husband were apprehensive about getting back into exercise after a five year break, but after our first session with Vikki we straight away looked forward to the sessions. Vikki shows you thoughly how to perform each exercise correctly and pushes you when you need the motivation! We would therefore highly recommend Vikki in helping you to help you to achieve your fitness goals.</blockquote>
										<h3>Laureen, 74</h3>
											<blockquote>During the pandemic I was told I must self isolate for 12 weeks.  During this time my fitness level declined severely. Whilst talking with a friend one evening she recommended Vikki as she had heard great things about her as a Personal Trainer.  This sounded just the thing I needed as I could do it online from my home, although at first I thought I would be too old. When I spoke with Vikki she was very friendly and positive she could get my fitness level back. She suggested 3 half hour sessions a week.  I only had a few weeks training with her and 3 half hour sessions was just about the right amount for me. I feel so much better not only in my body but also in my head and I can’t thank her enough for what she did for me. Vikki is very professional but also very approachable and I won’t hesitate to go back and start with her again.</blockquote>
										<h3>Tracy, 55</h3>
											<blockquote>My husband gave me three months notice to get ski fit, I am 55 and needed help! Vikki designed me a fantastic programme, based on three sessions a week for 12 weeks, she tailored the session to my ability and gradually increased my fitness in preparation for my holiday. Each session worked on different areas and she made it really fun (never thought I'd say that about gym training). I am now hooked and have told my husband I need a personal trainer all year round if he expects me to ski in my fifties! Thank you Vikki, I am really looking forward to my next ski holiday.</blockquote>
										<h3>Judy, 60</h3>
											<blockquote>I have just done my first ever circuits class with Vikki - and it was great! I was very anxious because I was about 30 years older than most of the other women there...and considerably larger. I needn't have worried. Vikki is so enthusiastic, caring and encouraging. She spent time with everyone and didn't just concentrate on the most athletic. She adjusted some of the circuits where my knees weren't up to what the others were doing. So I could still get a good workout and felt I had achieved something. It's made me realise it's not what type of exercise I do that makes me come back to a class again but the personality of the trainer.</blockquote>
										<h3>Alex, 30</h3>
											<blockquote>Excellent personalised service, Vikki really took the time to understand my goals and worked with my knee injury. Thanks for helping me focus on what I can do even with those limitations. I look forward to carrying on working with you, thank you for your help!</blockquote>
